The code in this directory contains the code for the benchmark sample called
Day Trader.  This sample was contributed by IBM to the Apache Geronimo project
under the ASF license to further functional and performance testing of Geronimo.  

-----------
|  BUILD  |
-----------
To build Daytrader, you need to have JDK 6 and Maven 3.0.3 or later
installed, which can be found at http://maven.apache.org.
Once installed you can build Daytrader by executing the following command
from the dayTrader root directory (the directory containing this README):

  $ mvn clean install


-------------
|  INSTALL  |
-------------
1. Install a local PostgreSQL server and create a database
	Database: daytrader
	User: daytrader
	Password: daytrader
	
2. Download and unpack JBoss EAP 6.4

3. Start JBoss EAP with full profile:

	JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
	
4. Download PostgreSQL JDBC drivers:

	http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/postgresql/postgresql/9.4-1206-jdbc41/postgresql-9.4-1206-jdbc41.jar
	
5. Start JBoss EAP CLI:

	JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh
	
6. Install PostgreSQL JDBC Driver on JBoss EAP:

	module add --name=org.postgresql --resources=/path/to/postgresql-9.4-1206-jdbc41.jar --dependencies=javax.api,javax.transaction.api
	
7. Add a JDBC driver definition to JBoss EAP:

	connect
	/subsystem=datasources/jdbc-driver=postgresql:add(driver-name=postgresql,driver-module-name=org.postgresql,driver-xa-datasource-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver)
 
8. Define required JMS destinations by adding the following snippet in the "messaging" subsystem:

    <jms-destinations>
        <jms-queue name="TradeBrokerQueue">
            <entry name="java:/jms/queue/TradeBrokerQueue"/>
        </jms-queue>
        <jms-topic name="TradeStreamerTopic">
            <entry name="java:/jms/topic/TradeStreamerTopic"/>
        </jms-topic>

        ...
    </jms-destinations>
    
9. Copy PROJECT/javaee6/assemblies/daytrader-ear/target/daytrader-ear-3.0.16-SNAPSHOT.ear into JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments

---------
|  RUN  |
---------
1. Access the dayTrader application at:
         http://<hostname>:<port>/daytrader (This is for traditional servlet and jsp)
         http://<hostname>:<port>/daytrader/index.faces(This is for JSF)
2. Before you begin using Daytrader, theres are a couple setup steps:
   - Re-create daytrader tables
   - Populate the database with a set of fictional users, stocks, prices, etc.
     by selecting:
         'Configuration -> (Re)-populate Trade Database'.
     Note: This may take a minute or two depending on your database server.
   - After populating the database, the Daytrader Configuration options will
     appear.  Just accept the defaults.
3. Now you can begin trading by going to:
         'Trading & Portfolios'   

---------------
|  UNINSTALL  |
---------------
To uninstall Daytrader, issue the following commands:

1. If you installed Daytrader as an application (EAR) using the deployer:
      deploy.[bat|sh] undeploy org.apache.geronimo.daytrader/daytrader/<version>/car
